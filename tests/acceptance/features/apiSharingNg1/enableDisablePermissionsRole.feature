Feature: enable disable permissions role
  As a user
  I want to enable/disable permissions role on shared resources
  So that I can control the accessibility of shared resources to sharee

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: users list the shares shared with Secure Viewer after the role is disabled (Personal Space)
    Given the administrator has enabled the permissions role "Secure Viewer"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folderToShare"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "hello world" to "folderToShare/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | <resource>    |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | Secure Viewer |
    And user "Brian" has a share "<resource>" synced
    And the administrator has disabled the permissions role "Secure Viewer"
    When user "Alice" lists the shares shared by her using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should contain resource "<resource>" with the following data:
